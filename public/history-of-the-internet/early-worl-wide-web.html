				    <p>The World Wide Web ("WWW" or simply the "Web") is a global information medium 
				    which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term 
				    is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service
				    that operates over the Internet, just as e-mail also does. The history of the Internet dates
				    back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web.</p>
				    <br>
				    <p>In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, an independent contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear 
				    Research (CERN), Switzerland, built ENQUIRE, as a personal database of people and software models, 
				    but also as a way to play with hypertext; each new page of information in ENQUIRE had to be linked to 
				    an existing page.[3]
                    Berners-Lee's contract in 1980 was from June to December, but In 1984 he returned to CERN in a permanent
                    role, and considered its problems of information management: physicists from around the world needed to 
                    share data, yet they lacked common machines and any shared presentation software.</p>
