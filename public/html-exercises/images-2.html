        <p><img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="This is a cute baby."  width="200px" height="150px"P>When I was a child, I was very shy. I was always playing alone and found it hard to befriend other kids. 
        I was an introvert. when I started school, I became more extrovert and began making friends in school. I was 
        always an honor student back then and I could still remember the proud faces of my parents everytime they pinned ribbons and 
        placed medals on me.
