        <h4>Top Picks: A blog of my Bests and Greatests</h4>
        <p><em>My Top 3 Favorite movies</em></p>
        <p>The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xko1Mx5w4tg"> Percy Jackson & the Olympians:The Lightning Thief </a>.
        This is one of my favorites because I am fascinated even as a child about greek and Roman Mythology. I often read my sister's books 
        in school about mythology. This movie is based from the book series written by Rick Riordan. It is a good story about how the ancient greek myths
        aren't just myths and they still exist to this day.</p>
        <p>Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znTLzRJimeY"> Troy</a>. I love this movie because aside from it depicts one of 
        the most epic wars in Greek mythology is that it has a lot of action. it's effects are also decent considering that it was first released in 2004.
        I read about the Iliad where the trojan war was illustrated when I was in grade 4 that is why I really wanted to watch this movie then
        and a lot more times to this day.</p>
        <p>Finally, the top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5X-hFf6Bwo"> The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a>.
        This is my ultimate favorite movie because it has a lot of war scenes and it is the conclusion to the epic The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
        It has also a decent visual effects then when it aired in 2003 but when I watched it again, the effects doesn't seem very good but the fight scenes 
        are still very exhilarating so I watch it still every once in a while.</p>

        <p><em>My Top 3 Songs of my Playlist</em></p>
        <p>my third most favorite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo9-_08T1GQ"> I Can't Make You Love Me by Leroy Sanchez </a>.
        because it always relaxes me and makes me reminisce about my life. I like this cover because the singer's voice is very relaxing.</p>
        <p>Next to my top 3 songs in my playlist is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvHWsbdVf20&spfreload=10"> Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now by Migz Haleco </a>.
        I like this song because it is relaxing and I like acoustic covers of old love songs. This cover is a good one because their voices blend well.</p>
        <p>Finally, the top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA"> Let Her Go by Passenger</a>. this song is my most favorite song because 
        it easily relaxes me. It also has a good meaning. the voice of the singer also is unique.</p>
